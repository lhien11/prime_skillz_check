	// 1 - After the DOM loads, add a paragraph tag that says "Page loaded"
	// to the section element
$(document).ready(function(){
	// 2 - Change the text of the h1 element to something (anything!) else.
  $('h1').text("Hien!");
  // 3 - Get rid of (delete) the useless unordered list (ul) by first
  // selecting the h2 nested within its list item.
  $('ul').empty();

});

// Read the directions on this one carefully. It looks like you missed step 1.
// And then for step 3, how could delete, not just empty the 'ul', by selecting the 'h2'
// instead of selecting the 'ul' directly.
